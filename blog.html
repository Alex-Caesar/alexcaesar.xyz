    <p>
      You might not have noticed yet but this version 0.0.1 is an extremely
      simple website with only html and like one line of CSS for the background.
      Keep it stupid simple (KISS) is the design philosophy for this version of
      the website which brings tremendous benefits in terms of management and
      performance despite some features lacking such as reactivity. This first
      version was implemented with
      <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> and domain networking so the
      only real bottleneck is the network speed, also known as latency, which is
      a sweet deal compared to other setups where you have tons of dependencies
      and media bogging load time down. There is not much accessability features
      but atleast you dont have a white background!
