      <i>"A picture is worth a thousand words"</i> - Fred R. Barnard who was an
      advertising executive. Are advertisements a piece of art? Art has always been something incredibly
      interesting to me whether it is in a museum or found in the kitchen or
      seen in the composition of a mathmatical proof. The media medium, style of
      expression, signature of the creator, and the attempt to capture and
      communicate meaning is simply fascinating. <br />

        >Pre-Historic Cave drawings</a
      >
      are some of the earliest forms of communication which came before the advancement of written and even then there are so many beautiful levels of
      expression and culture. I would encourage you to take a moment to checkout <a href="http://archeologie.culture.gouv.fr/archeo-sous-marine/en/cosquer-cave">this crazy discovery about the Cosquer cave</a> and imagine what a distinctely different yet strangely familiar world
      our ancestors lived in. I wonder what our future successors will relate to and be confused about from the artifacts which survive the weathering of time. Most likely, they will find  scattered heaps of plastic tupperware and wonder who thought it was a good idea to mass-produce a chemical that we have no known means of properly disposing of.
      <br /><br />All of this is to say that I added an image and an icon to the
      website.

      You might not have noticed yet but this version 0.0.1 is an extremely
      simple website with only html and like one line of CSS for the background.
      Keep it stupid simple (KISS) is the design philosophy for this version of
      the website which brings tremendous benefits in terms of management and
      performance despite some features lacking such as reactivity. This first
      version was implemented with
      <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> and domain networking so the
      only real bottleneck is the network speed, also known as latency, which is
      a sweet deal compared to other setups where you have tons of dependencies
      and media bogging load time down. There is not much accessability features
      but atleast you dont have a white background!
