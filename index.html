     <p style="margin-left: 10px; width: 600px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;"> I have always been drawn to building things, from my childhood constructing Lego creations to delving into Software Development on a Raspberry Pi at the age of 13 with the guidance of my Dad. <br><br>

        During my teenage years, I also explored music, video, and game production. I do not ever want to stop learning and making. <br><br>
        
        As an avid user of technology, I like technology that works but I LOVE technology that ‚Äújust work‚Äù out the box with top-notch performance and efficiency right out of the box, regardless of the environment. <br><br>
        
        My passion is Enabling, Automating, and Integrating Tools or Technologies with excellence so help make the products or services that ‚Äújust works‚Äù. <br><br>
        
        At an Organizational level, I want to Instill a Culture of Continuous-Improvement to drive Business Growth and refine the Developer Experience. <br><br>

        <strong>My goal</strong> is to explore all that the world has to offer while spreading hope and helping people climb <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs</a>.
